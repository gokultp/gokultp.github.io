I was in a journey with http for last few days,  was started from one of my old programs which was written in my college days.
When I have just gone through my old github repositories, one of those programs was came to my attention, especially one line of code.

```c
if(listen(welcomeSocket,5)==0)
   printf("Listening on 7000\n");

```
